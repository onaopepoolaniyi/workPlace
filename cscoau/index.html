                <p align="justify">The Department of Computer Science and Engineering (formerly known as Department of Computer Science) was established in 1970 having about ten students in the department, with a focus to meet the nation’s needs for skilled manpower in the rapidly expanding field of Information and Communications Technology. All efforts were geared towards the production of hardware Systems Engineer, Software Systems Engineers, Systems Analysts and Programmers. Following this realisation, in 1976, new programme options were introduced. The single honours degree in Computer Science was introduced to meet the needs in all the areas of Software Computing; and later, the Computer Engineering was also later added to cater for the growing demand for experts in the hardware computing. It is in recognition of the Department continuing to sustain the impact already made and increase the scope and achieve the set goal, the name of the Department was later modified to Department of Computer Science & Engineering to reflect the additional programmes. After a study of the requirements of the industry, commerce, government and research organizations, two undergraduate programmes were established. They are: Computer Science with Economics Computer Science with Mathematics The first set of students graduated from these programmes in June 1976. A postgraduate diploma course in Computer science was introduced in 1974 with the first graduate in 1976. A third undergraduate programme (Computer Engineering) was added in 1983. </p>

In the beginning, lecturers were drawn from Mathematics, and Electronics both in teaching of the courses and serving as external examiners to moderate the examinations. The Department has since trained her own indigenous staff members; some were trained abroad while others were trained locally. These form the great majority of lecturers within the Department today.</p>
